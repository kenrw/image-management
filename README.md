Media Management
=====================
Media Magement app.  This app will allow a guest (no login) to upload media.  Media can be an image, video,
or an URL of an image or YouTube video.

Once in a particular folder, the media is listed, and can be drag/drop sortable using the jQuery UI sortable function.

* Add caption, copyright info, photographer name, license, etc.
* YouTube Video should extract the first image from the YouTube service which provides stills of video.
* Uploads via URL will use a "wget" like feature to "upload" from the URL and store in directory

The first version should have no or minimal CSS.  No HTML5 drag-and-drop for the first version.
